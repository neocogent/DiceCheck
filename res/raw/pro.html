	<div class='title'>Pro Version</div>
	<div class='info'>There currently is no "pro" or "paid" version of DiceCheck. I am considering enhancements 
	that make it more useful to those willing to pay a wee bit for that.<p>
	My ideas so far are maybe adding better statistical analysis, 
	more advanced methods, export or reports, and perhaps a file export with roll data.<p>If you would buy a pro 
	version with some enhancements please let me know. If there is enough interest to warrant the extra work I may do it. In 
	the meantime, if you'd like to reward what has been done so far a bitcoin donation is always welcome.<p>
	<span class='nag'>(yes, you should check this bitcoin thing out too)</span>
