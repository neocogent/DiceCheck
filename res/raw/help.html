	<div class='info'>This app allows you to test dice or coins for bias or fairness.<p>
	Click on the "sides" value to choose how many your die has and then 
	for each roll/flip you press a button on the display to enter it.<p>
	Once enough rolls/flips have been entered check the STATS page for a statistical analysis. You can save the rolls 
	for later use by pressing the "disk" button at page top, or clear the rolls/flips with the "curved arrow" button.<p>
	The file name will then show up on the LOG page where you can easily load it again later, and continue adding more rolls/flips. 
	Long press on a log name for a few more options: merge into another 
	log, rename or delete a log.<p>You can set button style, sounds, vibration and other options on the settings menu.<p>
	Pretty simple overall. That's about it. Hope it's useful for you.</div>
