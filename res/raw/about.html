	<div class='info'>I'm just a regular programmer dude and not some <i>stats wizard</i>. I came across 
	this <a href='http://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2009/02/testing-balanced-die.html'>blog post</a> about analyzing dice fairness 
	and had quite a bit of fun playing with dice and coins to see how fair they were. I thought it would be useful as a ready-made app, 
	saving people from getting out a pad of paper and counting and calculating manually.<p>
	I used this mainly for testing coin flips as way to create Bitcoin private keys 
	and wallet seeds. You see, you can flip four coins to generate hexadecimal digits and be sure no hacker is messing with your bits 
	(use 4x4 digit grid, the first two coins selecting row, and last two coins column, it's a quick mental conversion). After many 
	hundreds of rolls I found you get better randomness with small coins in a big cup.<p>
	Maybe D&amp;D or Fantasy Football players can use this to check dice fairness too.<p>
	If you found this app useful, and want to support further app development (no ads!), I always welcome bitcoin donations.<p>
	<span class='nag'>(yes, you should check this bitcoin thing out too)</span>
